# Medical-3D-Printing
Project I worked on for a year and a half during my undergrad, coded fully in python . The Project is used to create 3d printed moulds from a patients X-ray CT scans. These moulds lay on plastic mesh and deliver radiation therapy.

This is an example of the thermoplastic mesh we build the 3D moulds on, after taking any x-ray scan of this mesh, we can build a closed surface model and then generate a perfectly fitted mould to be placed on the mesh.
