# Medical-3D-Printing
Project I worked on for a year and a half during my undergrad, coded fully in python . The Project is used to create 3d printed moulds from a patients X-ray CT scans. These moulds lay on plastic mesh and deliver radiation therapy.

This is an example of the thermoplastic mesh we build the 3D moulds on.
